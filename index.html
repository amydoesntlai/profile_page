The title of this page is taken from the fantastic poem <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56Iq3PbSWZY">"Litany" by Billy Collins</a>.  The text is below, but it's more fun to watch him recite it.

Litany<br />
<br />
You are the bread and the knife,<br />
The crystal goblet and the wine...<br />
-Jacques Crickillon<br />
<br />
You are the bread and the knife,<br />
the crystal goblet and the wine.<br />
You are the dew on the morning grass<br />
and the burning wheel of the sun.<br />
You are the white apron of the baker,<br />
and the marsh birds suddenly in flight.<br />
<br />
However, you are not the wind in the orchard,<br />
the plums on the counter,<br />
or the house of cards.<br />
And you are certainly not the pine-scented air.<br />
There is just no way that you are the pine-scented air.<br />
<br />
It is possible that you are the fish under the bridge,<br />
maybe even the pigeon on the general's head,<br />
but you are not even close<br />
to being the field of cornflowers at dusk.<br />
<br />
And a quick look in the mirror will show<br />
that you are neither the boots in the corner<br />
nor the boat asleep in its boathouse.<br />
<br />
It might interest you to know,<br />
speaking of the plentiful imagery of the world,<br />
that I am the sound of rain on the roof.<br />
<br />
I also happen to be the shooting star,<br />
the evening paper blowing down an alley<br />
and the basket of chestnuts on the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
I am also the moon in the trees<br />
and the blind woman's tea cup.<br />
But don't worry, I'm not the bread and the knife.<br />
You are still the bread and the knife.<br />
You will always be the bread and the knife,<br />
not to mention the crystal goblet and--somehow--the wine. <br />
<br />
